In this program, a simple microwave oven controller was designed using the FRDM KL-43Z
board and the MCUXpresso SDK. The goal was to create an embedded system that uses a button to start
the microwave, an LCD display to show its status, and a relay to control the oven. The code is written in C
and demonstrates basic concepts in embedded systems programming, such as GPIO and UART communication.
